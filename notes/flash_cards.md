Flash cards - Thomas Frank's Strategy:

1. Make your own flash cards
- messing with new information is important in learning it
- your own words, pictures, methods of explaining

2. Mix images with words
- people remember images more than words

3. Mnemonic devices
- create a mental association between two pieces of information
ex: associative imagery or acronyms such as ROY-G-BIV

4. Only one question per cards
- no illusion of competence

5. Break complex conceptions into multiple questions
- no illusion of competence

6. Say your answers out loud when studying
- no illusion of competence

7. Study flash cards in both directions
- you need to build links both ways to recall

8. Don't treat flash cards like a silver bullet
- there are many other methods of studying
ex: quiz, practice problems, mind maps, Venn diagrams

9. Spaced Repetition!!!!!

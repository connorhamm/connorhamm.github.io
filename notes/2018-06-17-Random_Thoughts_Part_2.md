# Introduction
To take a more physical than philosophical approach to combatting mentality, I have peeked into the complex and for the most part over my head, science of nutrition.  There were several influences along the way including health documentaries "What the Health", "Food Inc.", and "The Magic Pill", as well as doctors, nutritionists, TED Talks, etc.  However, the hands down winner that started me on this path, was a TV show called "Mr. Robot".  "I'm talking about all organized religion. Exclusive groups created to manage control. A dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope. His followers, nothing but addicts who want their hit of bullshit to keep their dopamine of ignorance. Addicts. Afraid to believe the truth. That there's no order. There's no power." [Elliot, Mr. Robot] I didn't particularly aim this quote at religion, but to everything.  I started to find habits of my own creation that are deemed normal, but were detrimental to my health, my happiness, and my productivity.


The leading cause of death in this world is from heart disease. [needs stats]

One of many diseases that can be decreased significantly with proper nutrition.  The health problems that our countries face is currently in an epidemic.  In this age we pump billions into research to battles disease that could have been treated with a proper diet.  I will try not over generalize, but it many cases this is accurate.  If we look at low income countries, forced to live of cheap grains and oils, its no wonder why they have lower life expectancies.  Many organizations approve of a low fat and high carb diet, but in reality our bodies want the exact opposite.  There are so many factors in food that impact your health and much of this information escapes me.  However, I have found several Netflix documentaries and some doctor's such Dr. Eric Berg, to be enlightening and thoroughly explaining in terms of Health Science.  Furthermore I have adapted a ketogenic diet.  In the state of ketosis your body is incredibly effective at burning your own body fat as fuel and the energy you do consume is more effective and recycled.  Overall you will become leaner, less brain fog, and have more stable energy levels.  My intake of carbs is less than 30g, protein is .7 * body weight, fat takes up the rest of my caloric intake.  In order to stay in the state of ketosis, less than 20 - 30 g of carbs should suffice.  The way I obtain my carbs is typically from vegetables.  The protein levels depend on your level of activeness, which I have determined the ratio of .7g per pound to be effective for me.  Proper protein consumption is important in maintaining and growing muscle.  I prefer to obtain my protein sources from fatty fish and grass fed beef.  If a good protein resource isn't available to me, I supplement with a protein powder isolate.  A healthy amount of fat is important, this can vary from person to person.  If I am using macros, it will be the determining factor of how many calories I decide to cut or add to my diet.  The types of fats can range from toxic to incredibly healthy for your body.  Toxic oils that are highly processed such as soybean oil and corn oil will be cheap and inflammatory to your body.  The healthiest oil on the market that is still very well priced would be coconut oil with its large amount of saturated fats which we have heard are unhealthy.  However we are used to seeing saturated fat as long chain fatty acids and coconut oil has medium-chain fatty acids which act entirely different. They are broken down easily for energy in the liver and don't get stored as fat hence boosting metabolism and weight loss.

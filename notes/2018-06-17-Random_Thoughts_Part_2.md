# Introduction
To take a more physical than philosophical approach to combating mentality, I have peeked into the complex and for the most part over my head, science of nutrition.  There were several influences along the way including health documentaries "What the Health", "Food Inc.", and "The Magic Pill", as well as doctors, nutritionists, TED Talks, etc.  However, the hands down winner that started me on this path, was a TV show called "Mr. Robot".  "I'm talking about all organized religion. Exclusive groups created to manage control. A dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope. His followers, nothing but addicts who want their hit of bullshit to keep their dopamine of ignorance. Addicts. Afraid to believe the truth." [Elliot, Mr. Robot] I didn't particularly aim this quote at religion, but to everything.  I started to find habits of my own creation that are deemed normal, but were detrimental to my health, my happiness, and my productivity.

# Health
I was never really taught about nutrition through family or through my education.  I never understood the interactions between calories, carbs, fats, proteins, minerals, and vitamins.  Reading the nutritional label on the back of a product was nonsense to me.  My relationship with food is slowly changing and become a more conscious decision as I know the power behind it.  I began flipping everything I knew on its head, following a diet that was the exact opposite of what I was used to with a corresponding food pyramid flipped on its head rather than the traditional one.

This is when I noticed my prior diet was filled with addiction and weakness.  Flipping off and on between this diet, unable to control myself, I found that food really was an addiction that needed fixing.  Food is something we should all enjoy, regardless if it is good or bad for you, however relying on it to feel good forms a hard to break addiction.  The most common detrimental addiction is to sugar.  There is nothing good about sugar at all.  Sugar causes insulin resistance, blood sugar spikes, rapid weight gain, inflammation, and the list goes on and on.  After removing sugar from a diet your body adapts, and sugary substances become not as desirable and less is required to satisfy.  As Dr. Eric Berg explains "it is not normal to have this incredible desire to have sweets... but while eating sugar, I wanted it more and more and more...".  Fortunately there are now many ways to ween off a sugar addiction, which include substituting with healthy artificial sweeteners, low-carb flours, and learning to be a better cook in the process.  

# Intermittent Fasting
While learning about ways to become more lean, I came across something called intermittent fasting.  There is a hormone called insulin that helps stores fat and it is triggered by eating.  In the presence of it, you can't lose weight and it blocks growth hormone.  Therefore fasting stops insulin spikes from preventing weight loss and muscle gain.  The system I have been using that appears to be effective is 16-20 hour fast window and 4-8 hour eating window.  To build up to this was a gradual process however its effective is incredible.  To boost this system even more, I added workouts in the morning.  When scheduling workouts it is important to optimize the fat burning and muscle growth window by doing it during the fasting window and not directly at the end of it.  

- insulin is a powerful hormone that helps store fat
- in its presence you can't lose weight
- blocks growth hormone
- 20hr fast, 4hr eat, Lunch + Dinner, no snacking
- gradual process

- learning about caffeine
- caffeine dumps gylocogen "carbs" into bloodstream immediately
- caffeine increases keto bodies produced significantly after 4 hours
- caffeine fakes adenosine receptors
- exercise after caffeine intake

- my intake should be 2 cups max, or 1 cup & 2 tea, or just 1 cup,
- cycle every 14 days
  - day 1: 3/4
  - day 2: 1/4
  - day 3: none
  - day 4: none

6:30 - 7:00 pm - lunch
10:00 - 10:30 pm - dinner

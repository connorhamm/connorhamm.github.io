Flash Card My Technique:
1. Start with a concept
2. Break the concept down
3. Create the information Link
4. Format a reversible information Link w/ pictures, mnemonics, weirder the more memorable!!


- potentially attach high tier content with low level content as well
ex: Physical Layer with hub or patch panel
- remember to slow down, focus on digger deeper with a calm and steady mind, this will take time to master
- this information could also be diagramed/mind mapped for better understanding
- this also highlights unknowns

3,5,6,7,8 - still need work



My Zones to facilitate growth:

The Deep Work Chamber, a place with complete isolation, void of all distractions.
- My Desks
  - improvements:
    - wire management
    - new desk or desk structure
      - I need no background distractions,
        - facing wall... etc.
      - get rid of junk on both desks


The Open Office, a place filled with distractions and shallow tasks.
- Work

The Library, a vault of your information and information systems, my internal hard-drive.
- My Desktop
  - what do I really need this for?

- mini-library: laptop
  - I could make this my main information system

The Test, a performance that pulls on my library and validates it.
- Anki
- Other undiscovered test systems

The Art Gallery, a step back from everything to form new abstract ideas.
- Driving
- Walking
- Jogging
- A nap (15 min max!)

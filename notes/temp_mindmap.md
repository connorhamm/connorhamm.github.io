Reading:
For all of my reading, I am considering being more focused.  This entails taking notes when reading.  This leads me onto some different ideas.  I can henceforth maintain a collection of ebooks and read them on a kindle.  Take notes of the books I am currently reading in a notebook, then transfer my notes to digital form when writing about the books.  So here goes my strategy and habit implementation for reading...

Reading at home:
It is difficult to find peace and quite, but the raining soundtrack seems to be most effective.  Hence that will put me in the proper undistracted state of mind.  I need to have a notebook + pen ready to go for writing when I need to.  Perhaps reading at desk or outside when possible is a good option.  I will make notes, rewrite quotes I find interesting, and write basic ideas I have.  

- raining soundtrack
- notebook & pen
- don't rush
- concentrated/high value reading material (books recommended from Thomas Frank)

Reading at or on the way to work:
It is very difficult to read undistracted at work.  There is no notebook, but I can take notes on computer If I decide to read on here.  Reading on here isn't as enjoyable however.  I really want to be able to read critically and be able to call back on knowledge obtained from them.  Hence, taking notes is a necessity.  So, how do I accomplish this.  If I read at work, I must take notes, which means that my break time will not be a reading time for high value content.  It will be a time for more dispersed content.  Such as reading Lakshmi's blog, news articles, or sci-fi books for fun.  Creative and fun content.  On the drive I will also engage in dispersed reading.  Right now that includes sherlock holmes stories or whatever is fun and creative.  

- dispersed reading material (misc. books, news, )
- no note taking required

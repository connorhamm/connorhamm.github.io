Reading:
For all of my reading, I am considering being more focused.  This entails taking notes when reading.  This leads me onto some different ideas.  I can henceforth maintain a collection of ebooks and read them on a kindle.  Take notes of the books I am currently reading in a notebook, then transfer my notes to digital form when writing about the books.  So here goes my strategy and habit implementation for reading...

Reading at home:
It is difficult to find peace and quite, but the raining soundtrack seems to be most effective.  Hence that will put me in the proper undistracted state of mind.  I need to have a notebook + pen ready to go for writing when I need to.  Perhaps reading at desk or outside when possible is a good option.

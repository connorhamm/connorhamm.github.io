Flash Card My Technique:
1. Start with a concept
ex: Tennis Top Spin Serve
2. Break the concept down
ex: body movement, power, feet position, grip
3. Then explain the information you want to know
ex: Topspin Tennis Serve Grip -> continental
4. Tie together picture + info into reverse format
ex: front - Topspin Tennis Grip
    back - Picture w/ Continental name

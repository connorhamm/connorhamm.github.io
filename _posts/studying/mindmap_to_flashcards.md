My Mind Map:

1. Physical Layer: Devices, Cables, Protocols

2. Physical Layer: Devices
  - devices: hub, patch panel
    - hub: ports, bandwidth, logic
      - hub bandwidth: Shared
      - hub ports: USB, Ethernet
      - hub logic: ???
    - patch panel: ports, bandwidth, logic
      - patch panel ports: Ethernet
      - patch panel bandwidth: ???
      - patch panel logic: none

3a. Physical Layer -> Hub
3b. Hub ports -> USB or Ethernet
3c. Hub bandwidth -> shared
3d. Hub logic -> ???


4a.
Front - Hub ports
Back - Picture with Ethernet or USB Hub, highlighting ports

4b.
Front - Hub purpose
Back - Connections with shared Bandwidth

- potentially attach high tier content with low level content as well
ex: Physical Layer with hub or patch panel
- remember to slow down, focus on digger deeper with a calm and steady mind, this will take time to master
- this information could also be diagramed/mind mapped for better understanding
- this also highlights unknowns

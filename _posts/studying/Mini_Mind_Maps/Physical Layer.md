# Breaking it down

2a)
- Physical Layer: Devices, Cables, Protocols
  - devices: hub, patch panel
    - hub: ports, logic
      - hub logic: half-duplex mode
        - half-duplex mode: 1 directional, receive or send, not both
      - hub ports: USB, Ethernet
    - patch panel: ports, logic
      - patch panel ports: Ethernet
      - patch panel logic: none, just physical Connections

2b)
- Physical Layer: Device, Cables, Protocols
  - Cables: Serial Analog, Serial Digital, Parallel Analog, Digital Analog
    - Serial Analog: Frequency/Amplitude Modulation Radio (SSB)
    - Serial Digital: USB, SATA, DBV, MPEG
      - USB: 3.X, 2.X, 1.X,
        - 3.X: SuperSpeed applications
      - Type C: ???
      - Type A: ???
      - Micro: ??? similar to mini, smaller
      - Mini: ??? peripheral devices
    - Parallel Analog: VGA
    - Parallel Digital: DSL modem, dialup modem, HDMI, DVI, PCI-E

2c)
- Physical Layer: Device, Cables, Protocols
  - Protocols: IEEE802.X

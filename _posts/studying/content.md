My Strategy Example:

1. Physical Layer

2. Devices, Cables, Protocols
  - devices: hub, patch panel
    - hub: ports, bandwidth
      - ports: USB, Ethernet


3a. Physical Layer -> Hub
3b. Hub ports -> USB or Ethernet
3c. Hub bandwidth -> shared


4a.
Front - Hub ports
Back - Picture with Ethernet or USB Hub, highlighting ports

4b.
Front - Hub purpose
Back - Connections with shared Bandwidth

- potentially attach high tier content with low level content as well
ex: Physical Layer with hub or patch panel
- remember to slow down, focus on digger deeper with a calm and steady mind, this will take time to master
- this information could also be diagramed/mindmapped for better understanding

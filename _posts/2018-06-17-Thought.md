# Introduction
"In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity" [Sun Tzu, A Arte da Guerra]. Chaos is the only reliable constant in this life and often is what leads to a tipping point.  Living through it there is pain, burden, an internal struggle that must be fought.  There is a fine line between being consumed by it and residing safely in it's shadow.  A guilty mistake would be avoidance, letting the lingering feelings exponentially weighing you down.  In search of a middle ground, a calm focus can be obtained.  This calm focus filtering through the noise and traffic, providing insight and clarity to reality.  By concentrating on mind and body, progress will made.

# Philosophy
"I think human consciousness was a tragic misstep in evolution, we became too self-aware, ... we are things under the illusion of having a self... programmed with the assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody."  [Rust Cohle, True Detective]  Taking a step back through meditation, reflection, and surrounding oneself with nature, we can begin to detach oneself from self driven motives.  Motives that intend to distract and hinder our true potential and meaning, ultimately controlling us.  Ranging from food, education, entertainment, on and on, our self driven motives obscure and prevent ourselves from pushing further.  Living in comfortable bubbles until it is popped, and an overwhelming storm tears us apart.  From youth we are prepared improperly for this world, sheltered, hidden, and distracted.  I believe that this inherently starts us on a path of weakness and ignorance.  To thrive, this path must be diverged, leading us slowly back onto a hidden path unique to us, meant to be followed if we allow it.  Therefore, I don't believe that "everybody's nobody", but that there is a selfless and meaningful purpose that each one of can carry, that we have become blinded to through society's influence.  To make continual progress throughout our lives, ego must be eliminated.  "The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know." [Albert Einstein]  I admire this quote.  After college I felt more clueless than the start and still do for that matter.  This quote is calming and realistic.  People become so overwhelmed and scared of lack of knowledge it provokes shortcuts and panic induced reactions instead of addressing the problem at hand.  If you look around yourself, whether people seem confident and strong or shy and weak, we are in the same boat.  All of us are clueless creatures grasping at straws.  It is time to not give into emotions and societal influence, but to embrace our weaknesses and work towards a brighter and accepting future.

# Health
The leading cause of death in this world is from heart disease.  One of many diseases that can be decreased significantly with proper nutrition.  The health problems that our countries face is currently in an epidemic.  In this age we pump billions into research to battles disease that could have been treated with a proper diet.  I will try not over generalize, but it many cases this is accurate.  If we look at low income countries, forced to live of cheap grains and oils, its no wonder why they have lower life expectancies.  Many organizations approve of a low fat and high carb diet, but in reality our bodies want the exact opposite.  There are so many factors in food that impact your health and much of this information escapes me.  However, I have found several Netflix documentaries and some doctor's such Dr. Eric Berg, to be enlightening and thoroughly explaining in terms of Health Science.  Furthermore I have adapted a ketogenic diet.  In the state of ketosis your body is incredibly effective at burning your own body fat as fuel and the energy you do consume is more effective and recycled.  Overall you will become leaner, less brain fog, and have more stable energy levels.  My intake of carbs is less than 30g, protein is .7 * body weight, fat takes up the rest of my caloric intake.  In order to stay in the state of ketosis, less than 20 - 30 g of carbs should suffice.  The way I obtain my carbs is typically from vegetables.  The protein levels depend on your level of activeness, which I have determined the ratio of .7g per pound to be effective for me.  Proper protein consumption is important in maintaining and growing muscle.  I prefer to obtain my protein sources from fatty fish and grass fed beef.  If a good protein resource isn't available to me, I supplement with a protein powder isolate.  A healthy amount of fat is important, this can vary from person to person.  If I am using macros, it will be the determining factor of how many calories I decide to cut or add to my diet.  The types of fats can range from toxic to incredibly healthy for your body.  Toxic oils that are highly processed such as soybean oil and corn oil will be cheap and inflammatory to your body.  The healthiest oil on the market that is still very well priced would be coconut oil with its large amount of saturated fats which we have heard are unhealthy.  However we are used to seeing saturated fat as long chain fatty acids and coconut oil has medium-chain fatty acids which act entirely different. They are broken down easily for energy in the liver and don't get stored as fat hence boosting metabolism and weight loss.

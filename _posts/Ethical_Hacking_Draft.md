I first must state that I don't encourage and I am strongly against using the techniques I am learning for malicious purposes.  My intent for learning ethical hacking is for educational and security purposes.

Hacking is a term used to describe the ability to make a system do what you wanted to, rather than what it was designed to do.  For example, picking a lock with malicious intent would be considered hacking.  Whereas ethical hackers could be paid large sums by a locksmith company to pick their locks to find security holes.

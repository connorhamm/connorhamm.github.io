I used to think of multitasking as an important skill.  To be able to text friends, eating, taking classes, and playing games in between.  However I have learned multitasking doesn't exist.  In reality we are doing something called "time sharing".  Our brains can focus on one task at a time, hence what we are actually doing is increasing the frequency in which we jump from one task to another.  We create the illusion of getting many things done simultaneously, when in reality we are significantly decreasing the quality of work and productivity.

Lets separate tasks/decisions into 4 categories: Autonomy, Thinking, Doing, High Performance

Autonomy tasks/decisions require low physical and low mental effort.  These types of tasks should be attempted to be automated or eliminated where ever possible.  There are many decisions/tasks that waste our time and energy.  What clothes should I wear?  What should I eat?  What to watch on tv?  Should I go shopping?  Clothing can be planned out for the week or month in a simplistic fashion. Food can be made and prepared for the next several days.  Removing t.v all together will gain us valuable time.  Shopping can be turned into a routine instead of a decision and lists containing what is needed could be compiled for that specific day.  Doing things like this will open up our mind for more important decisions.

Thinking tasks/decisions require low physical and high mental effort.  When bouncing between taking classes which requires high mental effort and other tasks that don't.  We are producing brain jet lag.  This brain jet lag is the time wasted and effort from switching from one topic to the next.  This is why our most important work requires no distractions and to stay focused.

Doing tasks/decisions require high physical and low mental effort.  These tasks are the ones we just have to get done and we shouldn't think about them and just do them.

High Performance tasks/decisions require high physical and high mental effort.  These tasks are the most draining overall and they should be.  We can't stay in this mode too long and understanding how long is determined from person to person.  To allow ourselves to maintain this state longer, we must focus on making sure each task stays in its dedicated areas allowing your mental and physical performance to be optimal when needed.

Today I am writing down several decisions that I make on a daily basis and figuring out which ones I never needed to make in the first place.  Which is most of them.  Then figuring out how to optimize my time spent on the ones that really matter. :)

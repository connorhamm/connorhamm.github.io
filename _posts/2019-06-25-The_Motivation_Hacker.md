# Chapter Two: How Motivation Works
- MEVID
    - Motivation = (Expectancy x Value) / (Impulsiveness x Delay)
- **Expectancy** is your confidence of success
- **Value** is how rewarding and how fun a task is
    - Doing boring, pointless things causes low motivation
- **Impulsiveness** can be though of as distraction
- **Delay** is how far away the reward is
    - its possible to perceive delay differently
- **Expectancy** can incinerate all obstacles when combined with good planning
    - With low expectancy, your confidence is so low, you don't even practice
    - You have trained yourself to be helpless
- **Value**
    - High value example: Tasks are so fulfilling you can't help but grin to yourself
    - It's easy to mistake a bad motivation environment for not caring and vice versa
    - have fun demolishing boring necessities in your way!
- **Impulsiveness**

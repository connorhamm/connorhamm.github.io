Imagine a world of immortals.  A life where everyone was free from the ticking clock.  This seems like an fantasy, but I believe it will be inevitable if our species can survive long enough to achieve it.  The brain is an incredibly complex organ and while there are many secrets yet to be revealed, there is nothing supernatural about it.  It follows the same rules everything else does, and it is only a matter of time before we crack the code.  Whether we find ways to prevent the brain from aging, or we are able to upload our consciousness to a cloud based technology, it will happen.  Now the question is how will this effect our world?

To maintain the human body seems more difficult than it would be upload your consciousness.  With the technology to do this, the physical world will be pointless.  There will be no more need for humans to exist in the physical form at all if the same existence can be produced in a virtual world.  With systems built upon sustainable energy and flawless execution through the continuous adapting and improving from AI, we could live in this virtual world with absolute freedom.  A disturbing consequence leads to the question of what do we do then?

When everything humans can do has reached its peak, AI has taken care of everything for us, what is next?  Throughout evolution we have always lived on a system of work.  It is how our species has survived so long.  We always seek abundance.  Once we achieve one goal, we set out for another, and another, and another.  It is a unending cycle.  Throughout most of humans existence, laziness wasn't an option when just getting food and water to survive was a intense struggle.  So how will we adapt to this virtual world where work isn't required.  Perhaps our definitions of work will change.  I believe we would become more social beings with a strong desire to help one another.  To explore our creativity boundlessly together and live a more artistic lifestyle.

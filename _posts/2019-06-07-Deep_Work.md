Introduction:
	
	• Deep work is undistracted focus on important / valuable work
	• Isolation from everything is required
		• social media, electronics, people, everything...
	• work periods / time frames should be long and consecutive
	• a typical knowledge worker spends 30% time w/ emails and 60% time w/ electronic communication & internet browsing
	• Shallow work is cognitively undemanding and preformed while distracted
	• To learn complex subjects requires uninterrupted and intense concentration
	• To learn computer programming
		• e.g: a man locked himself in a room w/ no computer, just textbooks, note cards, and a highlighter
		• he used the technique of:
			• highlight -> notecards -> practice
			• made sure there was nothing in his room to distract him
	• to be valuable, you must be able to learn complicated things fast
	• deep work is becoming scarce and increasing in value
	• Cal Newport constructs his days with chosen deep work and shallow activities, unavoidable, that are batched into smaller bursts
	• lack of distraction helps remove nervous mental energy
 
Chapter 1: Deep Work is Valuable
	
	• Highly Skilled worker: In our economy, those good with working with intelligent machines will thrive
	• Superstars: As the talent market is more universal, those at the top will thrive
	• Owners: With invested capital in intelligent machines, those will thrive
	• Desired Attributes:
		• quickly master difficult things
		• produce with high quality and speed
	• experts reflect a pursuit of effort in a particular field
	• keep your attention focused on a specific field
	• receive feedback to improve / change your approach to:
	• keep your mindset where it has highest productivity
	• myelin: a layer of fatty tissue around neurons
		• allows cells to fire faster / cleaner
	• check out the book: Give & Take by Grant
	• High-Quality work Produces = (Time Spent) X (Intensity of Focus)
	• Residue: when switching tasks, you attention doesn't immediately follow, there is residue

Chapter 2: Deep Work is Rare
	
	• Other trends have become common place
		• Rapid communication
		• Active Social Media
		• Open Collaboration
	• Deep work's metrics are a " black hole"
		• Contribution and business behavior are hard to quantify
	• Principle of Least Resistance
		• Without clear feedback, we trend towards the easiest behaviors
	• Open-ended interrogative questions such as "Thoughts•" Is painfully frustrating
		• This is time-sucking, but is easier from the sender's perspective
	• Avoid administrative duties
		• Feymman, to avoid administrative duties, he made a myth that he is irresponsible and uses this as a reason to get out of doing extra things
	• Busyness is a proxy for productivity
		• Doing lots of stuff in a visible manner to demonstrate value is misguided
	• Trade-offs surrounding new tech is disregarded and assumed to be good
	
Chapter 3: Deep Work is Meaningful
	
	• Deep work and a good life has a strong connection for master craftsmen
	• Master craftsmen find great meaning in their work
	• Depth destroying behaviors are praised in society
		• Avoidance generates suspicion
	• What we choose to focus on and ignore can define our quality of life
		• Skillfully manage your attention!
	• 'The idle mind is the devil's workshop'
		• When focus is lost, your mind fixates on what is wrong instead of what is right
	• Best moments occur when:
		• Mind is stretched to its limits
		• To accomplish a difficult and meaningful task
	• Jobs are easier to enjoy than free time
		• Built in goals, feedback, challenges
	• Our minds like going deep regardless of the subject
	• Deep work generates flow state, which includes:
		• Stretching mind to its limits
		• Loosing yourself in the work
		• Flow generates happiness
	• Seek out opportunities for flow
	• Beautiful code is short and precise
	• Meaning is uncovered through effort due to skill and appreciation of the craftsmanship
		• Craftsman don't have rarified jobs
		• A sword doesn't have to be special, the effort and skill of the craftsman who made it is
		
Rule #1: Work Deeply
	
	• Dissertation: long essay on a particular subject
	• Example strategies of deep work:
		• Eliminate / minimize all other types of work
		• Rhythmic strategy, doing deep work for the same hours every weekday
	• Eudaimonia Machine by David Dewane
		• 5 Rooms
			• 1st Room: Gallery
				• Demonstrates examples of deep work
				• Designed to inspire users
			• 2nd Room: Salon
				• Coffee, Bar, couches, Wi-Fi
				• Designed for curiosity and argumentation
			• 3rd Room: library
				• The hard drive, archive, or vault of your information
				• Designed as a permanent record of all work produced
			• 4th Room: Office Space
				• Conferences, white boards, cubicles
				• Designed for shallow efforts
			• 5th Room: Deep Work Chambers
				• Soundproof, Isolation
				• Designed for total focus
				• Ideal scenario:
					• A process of spending 90 min inside, take a 90 min break, then repeat 2-3 times to reach peak of concentration for the day
	• Main obstacle for going deep:
		• Urge to turn your attention to something superficial
	• Finite amount of will power that depletes as you use it
		• Like a muscle that tires
	• Add routines and rituals to your life to minimize limited willpower needed to transition into a focused state
		• Setting a time, a quiet location, would allow you to use less willpower to start and keep going
	• Bimodal philosophy for  Deep Work
		• Dedicates stretches of time, min 1 day, to deep tasks
	• People will respect your inaccessibility if well-defined and advertised
	• Seinfeld uses a chain method
		• Marks calendar w/ a red 'X' when he writes a new joke for the day
		• Once he starts getting chains, he try's no to break them
		• Transforms this task into a habit
	• 90-min stretches doesn't yield much productivity in an ad-hoc style
	• Ad-hoc is something done for a particular purpose
	• Committing time for depth in a rhythm, in big chunks, e.g 2.5 -> 3 hrs is effective
	• It is a good idea to log hours in depth
	• Journalistic approach doesn't come easy and is a skill obtained by their deadline driven nature
	• Journalistic approach takes advantage of any free time that pops up
	• Cal Newport's strategy is to map out when he will work deeply at the beginning of each week
		• Then refines details later to save effort / energy
	• Waiting for inspiration is a bad plan
		• Instead ignoring is the better alternative
		• Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants
	• Build rituals that are strict!
	• Questions to ask yourself when trying to setup a deep work routine
		• Where you will work, and for how long•
			• Specify location, ideally a location for depth only
			• Set a specific time frame, gives it a challenge
				• No open endings
		• How you'll work once you start to work•
			• Structure the work to avoid wasted will power deciding
		• How you'll support the work•
			• Exercise, diet, walks, find what works!
			• Structure this as well to avoid waste
	• Radical environment change w/ significant investment of effort / money increases perceived importance
		• Perceived importance can provide motivational energy and focus
		• Psychology of strong commitment through setting up a good environment can unlock mental resources
	• Architecture of isolated offices with common connected area
		• Supports deep thinking and serendipitous encounters
		• Expose oneself to new ideas / places / people, but have a place for your isolation
	• White board effect: Some problems can be worked on side by side with another
		• Each pushing each other to greater depths
		• Carefully choose this type of engagement, it only applies to specific situations
	• 4DX framework is to help get through the gap between what and how
		• Focus on the wildly important
			• "the more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish"
			• Add some ambitious outcomes to pursue w/ deep work hours
			• Focus on saying 'yes' to the subjects you are longing and let this crowd out everything else
		• Action on the Lead Measures
			• 2 metrics: lead and lag
			• Lag: measures what you are trying to improve (past)
				• e.g: getting a promotion, mastering a concept
			• Lead: measures effectiveness of new behaviors (present)
				• e.g: time spent in a state of deep work for you wildly important goal
			• I can improve lead by tracking hours spent in deep work
		• Keep a compelling Scoreboard
			• Tracks tasks completed but more importantly the effort of each day
		• Create a Cadence of Accountability
			• Regular meetings to confront scoreboards
			• Encourages execution
				• With independent work, this can be effective with weekly reviews
	• 4DX helps support a lifestyle of depth and its regularity, not necessarily the intensity
		• Regularity > intensity
	• "I am not busy.  I am the laziest ambitious person I know"
		• In this example, a man fled to a place w/ no Internet or TV
		• Going online required biking to the library
	• "Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice;  it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body... paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done."
		• To strategize and use this technique, it can be used as follows:
			• Shutdown all work issues at the end of your workday
				• No email, no mental replays, no scheming
			• If you need more time, extend your workday and shutdown later
	• Some decisions are better left for the unconscious mind to untangle
		• Move on and don't dwell on certain things too long
	• Decisions that require the application of strict rules are good conscious mind
		• e.g: calculator
	• Decisions that are vague, lots of info, conflictions, restraints, many variables... are well suited for the unconscious mind
	• Conscious mind is like a computer / calculator
	• Unconscious mind is like a data center, with complex algorithms to sift through unstructured data
		• This can output ideas and solutions to complex problems
	• Walking on a busy street, driving on a complex road, maneuvering around obstacles, drains will power / directed attention
	• Walking through nature exposes you to fascinating stimuli, freed from challenges which helps recover willpower / directed attention
	• The work that evening routines replaces is usually not that important
		• It is common to reach your deep work capacity by the end of the workday
		• Therefore, shallow work will take its place
	• Implement a strict shutdown ritual
		• Series of steps you always do, and a set phrase at the end
			• e.g "Shutdown Complete"
		• Without shutdown, issues will battle for you attention
	• Capture items/ tasks to do before shutdown
		• These items will be taken care of when appropriate and will not interfere w/ your ritual
	• Regularly resting improves the quality of deep work
	
Rule #2: Embrace Boredom
	
	• The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained
	• To focus deeper, one must distance their dependence on distractions
	• Constant attention switching online has a lasting negative effect on the brain
	• When a brain is used to distraction, it's hard to shake the addiction
		• e.g. for every potential moment of boredom, you find yourself reaching for your phone
	• People who multitask all the time are mental wrecks
	• Deep work training consists of 2 main ideas
		• Improving your ability to concentrate intensely
		• Overcoming your desire for distraction
	• You can use the Internet in a focused and deep way, but for a distraction addict, it's not possible
	• Schedule in advance when you'll use the internet, and avoid it outside of these times
		• This minimizes, the number of distractions that will occur and let your attention selecting muscles strength
	• Schedule internet usage blocks at work to do the following things:
		• Check emails, research content, etc.
		• When blocked, you must be absolutely free from internet
			• turn off notifications!
			• Go airplane mode
			• Turn off computer
	• When stuck / blocked from lack of internet, switch to another offline activity or relax
		• Remember the idea, take a break from deep work, and don't fill time off with shallow work
	• If urgency is dire, at least add a gap (5 min) before you go online to separate the sensation and the reward
	• Scheduling internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training
	• Rewire your brain to eliminate the ability for distractions to hijack your attention
	• Another strategy to increase intensity of deep work, estimate the time it takes to do something, then give yourself an aggressive deadline to complete it
	• Try this experiment at most 1 time a week at first then increase
		• Keep deadlines right at the edge of feasibility
		• You should always beat the buzzer, but to do so will be very hard
		• Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond what most knowledge workers would find  comfortable
		• Use artificial deadlines to systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve
	• Productive meditation: take a time frame where you are physically but not mentally occupied
		• Focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem
		• Continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls
		• The purpose of these is to rapid improve your ability to think deeply
		• Your mind will rebel and try to switch topics to seemingly more interesting thoughts
		• Remember you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention
		• Your mind will avoid diving deeper and begin to loop on information you already know
		• Identify looping and distractions!
	• Structure your deep thinking
		• Start with a careful review of what variables you want to focus on
		• Store these into your working memory
		• After solving / addressing these variables, consolidate your gains
		• Then repeat this process by identifying your new variables
	• Humans can't internalize abstract information quickly
	• Humans can remember scenes very well
	• Ron White's Card memorization technique
		• Cement the image of walking through 5 rooms in your home
		• In each room, conjure a clear image of what you see
		• Fix in your mind a collection of 10 items in each room
			• These items should be large, like a desk
		• Establish an order in which you look at each room
		• Combined this is 50 items, so add 2 more
		• Then associate a memorable person / thing with each card
		• Then walk through your house and deck of cards together assigning the mental images you have for the card w/ the place
		• e.g. king of diamonds = Donald trump, 1st item in 1st room is a mat, hence Donald trump wiping mud off his shoes on the map, is the image
		• After completing a room, walk through it a couples times to retain info
	• There is nothing special about this card memorization technique
	• Any thought process rewiring to this level of attention can deepen and strength your ability to concentrate
	• If card memorization is weird and not appropriate to you, then find a replacement


Rule #3: Quit Social Media

	• Accept that these tools aren't designed to be evil
		• Some can be vital to happiness and success
		• BUT, reject the state of hyper connectedness
		• Don't give these tools such regular access to your time and attention
			• Use less
	• Friendships online are lightweight, shouldn't be the center of the user's social life
	• Don't justify the use of social media or anything just because it might have some benefit or from fear of missing out
		• This would ignore all negatives that come along
		• When adopting tools, keep a skeptic mind & approach
			• This type of approach is obvious for craftsmen and skilled knowledge workers
	• Craftsman Approach:
		• Identify core factors that determine success and happiness
		• Adopt a tool only if positives outweigh negatives
	• Reduce complexity in deciding what matters to you
		• Keep a list limited to what's most important
		• Keep descriptions high-level
		• Ex: being an effective teacher in the classroom, effective mentor to graduate students, being effective researcher
		• Go through the list of tools you currently use, and identify its impact; substantially positive, substantially negative, or little impact
	• Ex: Professional Goal: To craft well-written, narrative driven stories that change the way people understand the world
		• Key activities supporting this goal:
			• Research patiently and deeply
			• Write carefully and with purpose
	• Then apply the tools in comparison with these ideas / goals
	• There are situations where Facebook and other tools should be used
		• e.g: new college students who goals are to establish new friends by attending lots of events and socialize with lots of people
	• Law of vital few: 80% of a given effect is due to 20% of the possible causes
		• e.g: Out of 10-15 different activities you do, it•s the top 2 or 3 activities that make the most difference
		• Don't service these lower impact activities just because they provide "some" benefit
		• e.g: Instead of finding old friends on FB, take a good friend out to lunch
		• Get more and do more of the activities you know will yield large benefits
	• "packing party": pack up all your possessions, then only take out what you used / needed, after a while throw / get rid of the stuff you haven't used
		• This can be used w/ tech too, ban everything and only use what gives you high/large benefits
		• Notice the impact over a period of time, e.g: 30 days
		• Don't announce this experiment
			• Part of the delusion is that people actually want to hear what you have to say
			• Gaining an audience is easier than ever before because of the idea of "you like my status update and I'll like yours"
		• This is underserved agreements of attention
	• For many activities, tools, commitments, you won't understand their value until you sample life without them
	• Put more thought into your leisure time
		• Don't default to whatever catches your attention in the moment
	• Your 16 hours of full energy will increase the value of the 8 business hours
		• Your mental reserves are capable of continuous hard activity and just require a change and of course sleep
		• Doing this will perhaps teach what it means to live, and not just exist

Rule #4 Drain the Shallows:

	• Most people don't work 8 hours a day
		• Too many interruptions, web surfing, office politics, personal agendas
		• With fewer hours allocated, you spend them more wisely
			• Therefore more shallow time would be given up for deep work
	• Import quote on productivity:
		• "How can we afford to put our business on hold for a month to 'mess around' with new ideas•" • "How can we afford not to•"
	• Don't pursue all your timed spent in depth
		• Shallow work is needed in most jobs
		• Tame shallow work's quantity and control over you
		• Shallow work is bad when it drowns out your ~4 hours of deep work
	• The most adept thinker can't spend more than 4 hours in depth
	• Most spend their day on auto pilot, not giving thought about what they are doing w/ their time
		• Adopt a habit of pursing before action and asking "what makes the most sense right now•"
	• Divide the hours into blocks and assign activities to these blocks
		• Not all of these blocks need to be work related
		• Min length should be 30 min
		• At first estimates will be wrong
		• Interruptions and obligations break your schedule
			• If your schedule is broken, pursue and resize your schedule
			• Cross out and add to the side of it
			• The goal isn't to stick to a given schedule no matter what, it's to have a thoughtful say in what you're doing and will be doing
	• Make a goal to accurately predict the time tasks require
		• Add overflow blocks incase previous time blocks get blocked
			• e.g: If an import insight is discovered, it may be worth looking into
			• Afterwards, rebuild schedule and dive back into it
	• Remember the goal of a schedule isn't to force your behaviors into a rigid plan
	• Continually ask yourself "What makes sense for me to do with the time that remains"
	• Without structure, it's easy for your time to devolve into shallow
	• When determining whether a task is deep or not, ask "how long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate w/ no specialized training in my field to complete this task"
	• Tasks that tend to lever your expertise are deep
		• Return more value per time spent and stretch your abilities, and enhance improvement
	• It•s a waste of money to pay professionals to send emails and attend meetings all day
		• Need to say no to somethings things, and streamline others
		• Perhaps get an explicit approval ration on time spent on shallow work from boss
			• Perhaps your boss will say yes to shallow work, which is useful because it highlights your job doesn't support deep work
	• Deliberately... do specific things to preserve happiness
	• Limit shallow endeavors 
	• For excuses, avoid providing enough details that allows the requester to defuse it
		• Ex: "Sounds interesting, but I have schedule conflicts"
			• Also resist the urge to offer consolation prizes
			• A clean break is the best
	• Choose behaviors that reorient your focus towards the deep
	• Make people who send you email do more work
		• Cal Newport uses a sender filter
			• E.g: interesting@calnewport.com
			• Only responds if they match schedule and interests
		• You have the right to control your own incoming communication
			• Expectation resets might earn you even more credit when you do respond
	• The idea of all messages arriving in the same inbox, regardless of purpose and sender, is ridiculously unproductive
	• Answer this question before answering vague, time consuming, and interrogative questions:
		• "What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for brining that project to a successful conclusion•"
		• Minimize messages back and forth, and be very process oriented with your replies
	• Many academics just don't respond
		• They believe it's the sender's responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worth while
	• Don't reply to an email if these rules apply to it
		• Ambiguous, a reasonable response would be difficult
		• It doesn't interest you
		• No value
	• People adjust to your communications, don't fret

Conclusion:

	• Setting up early commitments and adding perceived value such as an expensive notebook can induce more careful thinking
	• Obsessive focus can be sparked by:
		• Feeling not good enough
		• Having limited time
		• Understand the value of the focus
	• Work on problems in your head when the time is presented

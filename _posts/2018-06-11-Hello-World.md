Hello World.

I can imagine that my audience will be close to none, yet I will pretend otherwise.  My name is Connor and I am a Test Engineering Tech.  The intention of my writings is to publish content I am learning about, hence by no means will this represent 100% accuracy.  With constantly changing content, the format may vary from miscellaneous thoughts to structured reports.  I find it important to note that I would much rather indulge in critical feedback than compliments.  This blog will serve as my canvas and a way of providing structure out of chaos. My inspiration is from a challenge made with a lovely and passionate writer @ http://theirrelevantdragonfly.blogspot.com. In conclusion, I am excited to share my projects, learning material, and random thoughts with the world.  I hope to publish new content every 1-2 weeks.  :-)
